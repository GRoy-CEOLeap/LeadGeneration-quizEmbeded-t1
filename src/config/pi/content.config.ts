  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How much does it cost?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely nothing upfront. Personal injury attorneys work on a contingency basis, meaning they only get paid if you win your case. There are no consultation fees, no retainer fees, and no hidden costs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long do I have to file a claim?',
      answer:
        'The statute of limitations varies by state, typically ranging from 1-3 years from the date of the accident. However, it\'s best to act quickly to preserve evidence and witness testimony.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the other driver wasn\'t insured?',
      answer:
        'You may still have options through your own uninsured motorist coverage or by pursuing a personal injury lawsuit. An attorney can review your policy and explain your options.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I have to go to court?',
      answer:
        'Most personal injury cases settle out of court. However, if a fair settlement cannot be reached, your attorney will be prepared to take your case to trial.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a case take?',
      answer:
        'Every case is different. Simple cases may settle in a few months, while complex cases can take a year or more. Your attorney will provide a realistic timeline based on your specific situation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What can I recover in a personal injury case?',
      answer:
        'You may be entitled to compensation for medical bills, lost wages, property damage, pain and suffering, and in some cases, punitive damages. Your attorney will evaluate all potential damages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a police report?',
      answer:
        'While not always required, a police report strengthens your case by providing an official record of the accident. If you didn\'t file one at the scene, you may still be able to file a report within a few days.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I was partially at fault?',
      answer:
        'Many states follow comparative negligence rules, meaning you can still recover damages even if you were partially at fault. Your compensation may be reduced by your percentage of fault.',
    },
